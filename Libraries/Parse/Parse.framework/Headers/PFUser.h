/*!
 The `PFUser` class is a local representation of a user persisted to the Parse Data.
 This class is a subclass of a <PFObject>, and retains the same functionality of a <PFObject>,
 but also extends it with various user specific methods, like authentication, signing up, and validation uniqueness.

 Many APIs responsible for linking a `PFUser` with Facebook or Twitter have been deprecated in favor of dedicated
 utilities for each social network. See <PFFacebookUtils>, <PFTwitterUtils> and <PFAnonymousUtils> for more information.
