 ### Subclassing Notes
 
 Developers can subclass `PFObject` for a more native object-oriented class structure.
 Strongly-typed subclasses of `PFObject` must conform to the <PFSubclassing> protocol
 and must call <registerSubclass> before <[Parse setApplicationId:clientKey:]> is called.
 After this it will be returned by <PFQuery> and other `PFObject` factories.

 All methods in <PFSubclassing> except for <[PFSubclassing parseClassName]>
 are already implemented in the `PFObject+Subclass` category.

 Including `PFObject+Subclass.h` in your implementation file provides these implementations automatically.
 
 Subclasses support simpler initializers, query syntax, and dynamic synthesizers.
 The following shows an example subclass:
 
     \@interface MYGame : PFObject <PFSubclassing>

     // Accessing this property is the same as objectForKey:@"title"
     @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *title;

     + (NSString *)parseClassName;

     @end
     

     @implementation MYGame

     @dynamic title;

     + (NSString *)parseClassName {
         return @"Game";
     }

     @end


     MYGame *game = [[MYGame alloc] init];
     game.title = @"Bughouse";
     [game saveInBackground];
