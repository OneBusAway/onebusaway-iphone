/**
 * \@safecategory defines the implementation of a safe category named \a CATEGORY on \a CLASS.
 * A safe category will only add methods to \a CLASS if a method by the same
 * name does not already exist (\e not including superclasses). If \c DEBUG is
 * defined and \c NDEBUG is not defined, any method conflicts will abort the
 * application at startup; otherwise, any method conflicts are simply logged,
 * and no overwriting occurs.
 *
 * This macro should be used in implementation files. Normal \@interface blocks
 * can be used in header files to declare safe categories, as long as the name
 * given in parentheses matches \a CATEGORY.
 *
 * To perform tasks when a safe category is loaded, use the \c +load method,
 * which functions identically to \c +load within a regular category. Any \c
 * +load method will be executed exactly once, and is not added to \a CLASS. \a
 * CLASS is guaranteed to have been loaded by the time \c +load executes.
 *
 * @note Depending on the protection level for the instance variables of \a
 * CLASS, a safe category may not be able to access them, even if a regular
 * category could. In practice, accessing instance variables in a category is
 * almost always a bad idea.
 *
 * @warning Protocol categories and safe categories interact in indeterminate
 * ways. If \a CLASS conforms to a protocol which has an EXTProtocolCategory,
 * and both the protocol category and the safe category implement a method by
 * the same name, the safe category may succeed sometimes and fail others.
 *
 * @bug Due to an implementation detail, methods invoked against \c super will
 * actually be invoked against \c self.
