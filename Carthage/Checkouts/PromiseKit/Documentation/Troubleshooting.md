# Troubleshooting

Sadly, Swift often gives misleading diagnostic messages for compile errors with
PromiseKit.

## Compile Errors

### Cannot convert return expression of type … to return type AnyPromise

Specify the return type for the closure. DON’T return `AnyPromise` (unless you
wanted to).

### Missing return in a closure expected to return AnyPromise

Specify the return type for the closure. DON’T return `AnyPromise` (unless you
wanted to).

### Ambiguous *bar*

Specify the return type for the closure.

### Confusing Errors

The best one I saw lately was *`UIImage` is not convertible to `UIImage?`*…

Swift’s diagnostic reporting will be flat-out misleading and wrong inside
complicated closures, and with PromiseKit we have a lot of those.

When specifying the `return` types doesn’t help try the advice in the next
section:

## Pain Free Swift Promises

The best way is to appease Swift is to decompose your chains into separated
local functions. For example:

```swift
func foo() -> Promise<Int>
    func step1() -> Promise<String> {
        // many
        // lines
        // of
        // code
    }
    
    func step2() -> Promise<Int> {
        // many
        // lines
        // of
        // code
    }

    return firstly {
        step1()
    }.then {
        step2()
    }
}
```

Otherwise try to always have your chain return to something that specifies the
promise type. This is easy when you are writing functions that return promises,
and in general this is what you should aim for anyway: because it makes your
promises more composable.

When you return promises from functions that specify the return type Swift can
infer the types properly and it makes writing chains that much easier.

## Neither `catch` or `then` are called in my chain

Check something didn’t throw a `CancellableError`. Easiest way is to amend your
`catch`:

```swift
foo.then {
    //…
}.catch(policy: .allErrorsIncludingCancellation) {
    // cancelled errors are handled *as well*
}
```

## `Pending Promise Deallocated!`

If you see this warning you have a path in your `Promise` initializer where
neither `fulfill` or `reject` are called:

```swift
Promise<String> { fulfill, reject in
    task { value, error in
        if let value = value as? String {
            fulfill(value)
        } else if let error = error {
            reject(error)
        }
    }
}
```

There are two missing paths here and if either occur the promise will soon be
deallocated without resolving. This will show itself as a bug in your app,
probably the awful: infinite spinner.

So let’s be thorough:

```swift
Promise<String> { fulfill, reject in
    task { value, error in
        if let value = value as? String {
            fulfill(value)
        } else if let error = error {
            reject(error)
        } else if value != nil {
            reject(MyError.valueNotString)
        } else {
            // should never happen, but we have an `PMKError` for task being called with `nil`, `nil`
            reject(PMKError.invalidCallingConvention)
        }
    }
}
```

If this seems tedious it shouldn’t. You would have to be this thorough without promises too, the difference is without promises you wouldn’t get a warning in the console letting you know your mistake!

## Slow Compilation / Compiler Cannot Solve in Reasonable Time

Add return types to your closures.
