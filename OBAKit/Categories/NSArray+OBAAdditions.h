 Groups the receiver by values of the specified key.
 e.g. if you have an array of objects [{category: clothes, name: socks}, {category: clothes, name: pants}, {category: tools, name: hammer}] and try grouping them on category, you'll end up with: {clothes: [{category: clothes, name: socks}, {category: clothes, name: pants}], tools: [{category: tools, name: hammer}]}
 
 Caution: This method will *not* include objects that return nil for the grouping key.

 @param key The key on which to group the receiver

 @return A dictionary similar to the one described in this method description
