# Apptentive iOS SDK

The Apptentive iOS SDK provides a simple and powerful channel to communicate in-app with your customers.

Use Apptentive features to improve your app's App Store ratings, collect and respond to customer feedback, show surveys at specific points within your app, and more.

## Install Guide

Apptentive can be installed manually as an Xcode subproject or via the dependency manager CocoaPods.

The following guides explain the integration process:

 - [Xcode project setup guide](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/ios/setup/xcode/)
 - [CocoaPods installation guide](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/ios/setup/cocoapods)

## Using Apptentive in your App

After integrating the Apptentive SDK into your project, you can [begin using Apptentive features in your app](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/ios/integration/).

You should begin by setting your app's API key, then engaging Apptentive events at various places in your app:

``` objective-c
#import "Apptentive.h"
...
Apptentive.shared.APIKey = @"<Your API Key>";
...
[Apptentive.shared engage:@"event_name" fromViewController:viewController];
```

Or, in Swift:

``` Swift
import Apptentive
...
Apptentive.shared.APIKey = "<Your API Key>"
...
Apptentive.shared.engage(event: "event_name", from: viewController)
```

Later, on your Apptentive dashboard, you will target these events with Apptentive features such as Message Center, Ratings Prompts, and Surveys.

Please see our [iOS integration guide](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/ios/integration/) for more on this subject.
