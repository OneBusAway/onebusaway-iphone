# What's in this fork?

Lots of good stuff! I've mostly focused on revising the UI and ensuring proper support for iPhone 5 and iOS 6. I've also spent a good deal of time updating the codebase to take advantage of new features like ARC, and also to reflect a more idiomatic Objective C syntactical style.
