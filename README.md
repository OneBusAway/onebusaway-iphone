### Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)
To ensure that the app source code remains fully open-source under a common license, we require that contributors sign [an electronic ICLA](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12jV-ByyN186MuPotMvxJtNKtSaGGTnEHm8rXomM2bm4/viewform) before contributions can be merged.

### Code of Conduct

### Picking an appropriate first-time issue

You are welcome to work on any bug or feature you would like, but we know that getting started in a new codebase can be intimidating. To that end, we recommend that you take a look at issues labeled as [Your First PR](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-iphone/labels/Your%20First%20PR). These issues are relatively small and self-contained, and should be perfect for anyone who is interested in getting their feet wet with the OneBusAway codebase.

(h/t to Microsoft's [ChakraCore](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore) project for the idea of the first PR)

### Development environment setup

1. Install Xcode 8.0.x
2. `git clone` your fork
3. install Carthage - see [carthage github repo](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for instructions, and you can download the latest release at https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases
4. `open org.onebusaway.iphone.xcodeproj`

You should now be able to build. See our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the specific workflow to add a new feature or bug fix.
