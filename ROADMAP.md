# Roadmap

These are things that we have expressed interest in but haven't implemented yet. Our [huboard](http://huboard.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-iphone/board) lists the highest priority items under the 'Ready' column. If you feel like you can complete one of the tasks, feel free to fork the project and send a pull request with the new code. We will work to release new updates to the App store frequently as bugs are fixed and new features are added.
