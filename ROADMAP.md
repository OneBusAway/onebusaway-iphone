# Roadmap

These are things that we have expressed interest in but haven't implemented yet. They are generally listed in order of priorities however don't let that stop you from implementing something out of order. If you feel like you can complete one of the tasks, feel free to fork the project and send a pull request with the new code. We should work to release new updates to the App store frequently.
